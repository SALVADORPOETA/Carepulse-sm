# CarePulse

This healthcare management system was developed following a tutorial by the YouTube channel JavaScript Mastery. It features real-time SMS notifications to streamline the checkup process, along with secure authentication and patient registration workflows. Users can fill out personal details, medical history, and identification, then schedule appointments with their preferred doctor through a smooth, guided booking experience. The system includes confirmation screens, access permission models, and a comprehensive admin panel to manage, reschedule, or cancel appointments—all with automated SMS alerts.

The project leverages Next.js with server-side rendering, nested layouts, server actions, and revalidation for optimal performance and scalability. It includes advanced and reusable form components such as date pickers, international phone inputs, and OTP verification, built using TypeScript, React Hook Form, and Zod. The UI is fully responsive and built with TailwindCSS and ShadCN/UI, while backend functionality is powered by Appwrite, including file storage and Twilio-based SMS notifications. Monitoring and error tracking are handled via Sentry, making this a full-featured and production-ready solution.
