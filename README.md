# CarePulse

🚀 Introduction

CarePulse-sm is a **healthcare management system** developed following a tutorial by the YouTube channel **JavaScript Mastery**, with significant **custom improvements implemented independently**.

The system offers real-time **SMS notifications** to streamline patient checkups and secure authentication and registration workflows. Users can submit personal details, medical history, and identification, then schedule appointments with their preferred doctor. The platform provides confirmation screens, access permission models, and a comprehensive admin panel for managing, rescheduling, or canceling appointments—all with automated SMS alerts.

This project demonstrates a **production-ready, full-stack solution** with enhanced UX and security improvements beyond the original tutorial.

## 📖 Pages

### Home Page

The CarePulse landing page serves as a dual-entry hub for both patients and administrators. It features a streamlined registration system validated via Zod and administrative access control through a session-encrypted Passkey gateway. The design emphasizes user experience (UX) with optimized input components like OTP and real-time schema validation.

## 🔧 My Personal Contributions & Improvements

### 🔐 Implemented Secure Admin Access with Passkey Modal, Logout Handling, and Route Protection

**Initial Problem:**
The original tutorial project had no proper access control for the admin dashboard. Clicking the "Admin" button allowed potential unauthorized access to `/admin`, there was no logout, and the route itself lacked protection.

**My Contribution:**

1. Validated the modal input on the homepage "Admin" button and stored the encrypted passkey in `sessionStorage`
2. Added a **logout button** in the admin dashboard header, clearing the session and redirecting users to the homepage
3. Implemented **client-side route validation** for `/admin` using the encrypted passkey stored in `sessionStorage` and the `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PASSKEY` environment variable. Unauthorized users are redirected to `/`

**Impact:**

* Lightweight but effective **access control** for the admin panel
* Sessions can now be actively terminated
* The flow from homepage access to protected route rendering is secure and seamless
* Demonstrates skills in **frontend security, state management, and route handling in Next.js**
